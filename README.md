# Fractal Reddit Customer Research Wesbcraping

Python scripts to scrape subreddits posts and send automated DMs to scrapped usernames. If using this script to do customer research, it is best to run it at a single time and try to really get as many DMs as possible out there as the Reddit account will get banned within about a day, or even within a few hours.

To optimize the process:
  - Create multiple accounts, at least one per subreddit to scrape.
  - Go to a subreddit like r/learnprogramming, r/starterpack, etc. and comment on people's posts to gain karma.
  - Once you have 50 karma, the DM feature should be enabled and you can start webscraping.
  
  Repeat as many times as needed!
